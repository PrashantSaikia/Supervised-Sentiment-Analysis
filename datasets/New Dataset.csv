"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack."
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
We are sending it back.
Raw and sublimely moving.  
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
The cr?pe was delicate and thin and moist.
") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  "
Pretty cool I would say.
The food was terrible.
Great product and price.
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
So they performed.
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."
"Overall, a great experience."
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  "
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
I love this device.
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  "
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place."
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!"
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
"I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality."
I probably won't be coming back here.
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."
Freezes frequently4.
Her role was played well.  
"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."
Very happy with this product.
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
You wont regret it!  
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
Earbud piece breaks easily.
"There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake."
Never got it!!!!!
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
Please dont waste your money.
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
Sauce was tasteless.
"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  "
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed."
"The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  "
A great touch.
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
Clear crisp sound.
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"
"Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet."
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
I am glad I purchased it.
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
Not my thing.
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
What a mistake.
I'm very disappointed with my decision.
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  
SWEETEST PHONE!!!
"It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days."
Not as good as I had hoped.
The music in the film is really nice too.  
"I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it."
"I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  "
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.
The waitress and manager are so friendly.
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet."
This one is simply a disappointment.
Go To Place for Gyros.
Basically the service was very bad.
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
And the sound quality is great.
camera color balance is AWFUL.
The food is very good for your typical bar food.
It just blew.  
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
The mic is great.
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
The reception through this headset is excellent.
"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  "
This is such a fun and funny movie.  
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
Lange had become a great actress.  
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts."
"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7."
Would recommend this item.
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
It is a joy to use.
It is a true classic.  
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
I'd like to return it.
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
"I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  "
This is a disgrace.
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  "
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
"If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!"
Food arrived quickly!
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
"It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out."
"Terrible product, and waste of money!"
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
"I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here."
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
The real disappointment was our waiter.
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
"The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter."
"I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while."
I have recommended it to friends.  
I hate movies like that.  
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
It was horrendous.  
The bartender was also nice.
Not enough volume.
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  "
"I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool."
It was a waste of my money.
"As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak."
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
"Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  "
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
"After one bite, I was hooked."
"This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts."
"The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary."
Meredith M was better than all right.  
"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
Terrible management.
worthless product.
"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  "
Worst customer service.
It was also the right balance of war and love.  
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
Linked to my phone without effort.
"A truly, truly bad film.  "
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
Happy so far!.
"You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  "
"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  "
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."
Now this dish was quite flavourful.
"For that, it's worth checking out.  "
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
"Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff."
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
Poor Reliability.
Warning - Stay away.
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
Best fish I've ever had in my life!
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
I will not be eating there again.
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
"Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call."
"You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!"
"This is a good battery, and it got here really fast."
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
Disappointed with battery.
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time."
"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."
dont go here.
Will order from them again!
Cumbersome design.
I'm a bit disappointed.
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
Would not recommend to others.
"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  "
"I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  "
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."
All the bread is made in-house!
"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  "
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  "
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
I can't wait to go back.
"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."
"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
"Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  "
I think not again
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
I highly recommend this device to everyone!
"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
Waitress was sweet and funny.
"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  "
Don't bother coming here.
This place should honestly be blown up.
"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  "
"Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!."
It is shameful.  
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
"Let's start with all the problems?the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  "
It definitely was not as good as my S11.
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
"Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem."
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
"Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  "
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.
